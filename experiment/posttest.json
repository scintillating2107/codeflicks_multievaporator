      "question": "What is the primary purpose of using multiple effects in an evaporator system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To reduce the boiling point of water",
        "b": "To increase the pressure in each effect",
        "c": "To improve energy efficiency by reusing steam",
        "d": "To increase the feed flow rate"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Boiling point does not significantly change with multiple effects.",
        "b": "Pressure usually decreases in successive effects.",
        "c": "Correct! Multiple effects reuse vapor to conserve energy. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-effect_evaporator'>Learn more</a>",
        "d": "Feed flow rate is a design parameter, not the purpose."

      "question": "Steam economy is defined as:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The amount of steam required per unit of product",
        "b": "The amount of vapor produced per unit of steam consumed",
        "c": "The rate of heat transfer in each effect",
        "d": "The cost savings in a steam plant"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is an inverse understanding of steam economy.",
        "b": "Correct! It measures efficiency of steam usage. <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/steam-economy'>More info</a>",
        "c": "Heat transfer rate is different from economy.",

        "a": "This is characteristic of backward-feed MEE.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Steam economy usually increases, not decreases.",
        "b": "Overall energy consumption reduces.",
        "c": "More effects mean more vapor is reused.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Pressure affects boiling point but not directly used in U calculation.",
        "b": "It affects flow but not the main calculation input.",
