        "a": "Mixing different chemicals",
        "b": "Separating solid impurities from a liquid",
        "c": "Concentrating a solution by removing solvent as vapor",
        "d": "Cooling a hot fluid stream"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Mixing is not the purpose of an evaporator.",
        "b": "This is the function of a filter or centrifuge.",
        "c": "Correct! Evaporators remove solvent (usually water) to concentrate the solution. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporator'>Learn more</a>",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cold water cannot supply heat for evaporation.",

      "question": "Why is vacuum often applied in evaporators used for heat-sensitive materials?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase pressure and speed up boiling",
        "b": "To raise the temperature of the feed",
        "c": "To lower the boiling point and avoid thermal degradation",
        "d": "To condense the vapor more quickly"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Vacuum decreases pressure, not increases it.",
        "b": "Vacuum is not used to raise temperature.",
