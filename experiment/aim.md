        <h1>Aim (Detailed)</h1>
        <p>
            The aim of this experiment is to study the working and performance characteristics of a multi-effect evaporator (MEE), which is a highly efficient industrial device used for concentrating solutions by evaporating the solvent, typically water, from the feed liquid. The primary objectives include understanding how multiple evaporator effects operate sequentially at decreasing pressures and temperatures, which allows reuse of the vapor heat from one stage to the next, thus significantly improving energy efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifically, this experiment seeks to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Observe and analyze the heat transfer processes involved in each effect of the evaporator.</li>
            <li>Determine the quantity of steam consumed and the amount of solvent evaporated to calculate the steam economy, which measures the efficiency of steam utilization.</li>
            <li>Calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient (U), an important parameter reflecting the thermal performance of the evaporator surfaces under operating conditions.</li>
            <li>Gain practical insight into the operational challenges and advantages of multi-effect evaporators compared to single-effect evaporators, including energy savings and process optimization.</li>
            <li>Understand the effect of varying operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, and feed concentration on the efficiency and output of the system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ultimately, this experiment aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of multi-effect evaporation principles, enabling efficient design, operation, and optimization of evaporators in industries like sugar processing, chemical manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals where large-scale solvent removal is critical.
