            The aim of this experiment is to study the working and performance characteristics of a multi-effect evaporator (MEE), which is a highly efficient industrial device used for concentrating solutions by evaporating the solvent, typically water, from the feed liquid. The primary objectives include understanding how multiple evaporator effects operate sequentially at decreasing pressures and temperatures, which allows reuse of the vapor heat from one stage to the next, thus significantly improving energy efficiency.
