        <h1>Theory (Detailed)</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Evaporation</strong> is a physical process that involves the removal of solvent, usually water, from a solution by heating it to its boiling point. This process concentrates the solution by reducing its volume and increasing the concentration of solutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <strong>Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE)</strong> is an apparatus used in industries for efficient and economical evaporation by utilizing multiple stages or "effects". Each effect is an evaporator operating at successively lower pressures and temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Working Principle:</strong> The fundamental principle behind the multi-effect evaporator is that the vapor generated from one effect is reused as the heating medium for the next effect. This reuse of latent heat drastically reduces the consumption of fresh steam.
        </p>
        <p>
            The feed liquid enters the first effect where it is heated by live steam, causing partial evaporation. The vapor produced here passes to the heating jacket of the second effect, which is maintained at a lower pressure, causing the liquid in the second effect to boil and evaporate using the heat of the vapor from the first effect. This cascading continues through all effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Key Parameters and Concepts:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Steam Economy:</strong> It is defined as the mass of water evaporated per unit mass of steam supplied. Higher steam economy indicates better energy efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient (U):</strong> This coefficient represents the efficiency of heat transfer between the heating steam and the solution. It is calculated by:
                    <br />
                    <em>U = Q / (A × ΔT)</em>,
                    where <em>Q</em> is the heat transferred, <em>A</em> is the heat transfer surface area, and <em>ΔT</em> is the temperature difference between steam and boiling solution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Boiling Point Depression:</strong> Due to the presence of solutes, the boiling point of the solution in later effects may be slightly higher or lower, which affects the vapor pressure and evaporation rate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Vacuum Operation:</strong> Lower pressure in subsequent effects is achieved by operating under vacuum conditions, which reduces the boiling point of the solution and enables vapor reuse.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Advantages of Multi-Effect Evaporators:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Significant reduction in steam consumption and energy usage.</li>
                <li>Increased capacity for large-scale evaporation processes.</li>
                <li>Lower operational costs compared to single-effect evaporators.</li>
                <li>Better temperature control reducing product degradation.</li>
                <li>Improved process efficiency through heat recovery.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Industrial Applications:</strong> Multi-effect evaporators are extensively used in sugar industries for juice concentration, in chemical plants for solvent recovery, in pharmaceutical production for solution concentration, and in food processing for concentrating juices, milk, and other liquids.
