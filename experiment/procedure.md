            <li>Ensure all valves and gauges are in proper working condition before starting the experiment.</li>
            <li>Switch on the main power supply and open the steam valve to introduce live steam into the first effect of the evaporator.</li>
            <li>Feed the liquid solution to be concentrated into the first effect's evaporator chamber at a steady, controlled flow rate using the feed pump.</li>
            <li>Allow the live steam to heat the liquid until it reaches its boiling point and starts vaporizing. Monitor the temperature and pressure carefully.</li>
            <li>The vapor generated in the first effect is directed to the heating jacket or coil of the second effect, which is maintained at a lower pressure, causing the liquid in the second effect to boil and evaporate by absorbing the heat of this vapor.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process for subsequent effects, each operating at successively lower pressure and temperature to maximize heat recovery and minimize steam consumption.</li>
            <li>Collect the concentrated liquid from the outlet of the last effect as the final product, ensuring continuous monitoring of concentration levels and flow rates.</li>
            <li>Record the temperatures of the steam, boiling liquid, and vapor at each effect, as well as the pressure in each chamber throughout the experiment.</li>
            <li>Measure the quantity of steam supplied to the first effect using the steam flow meter and the quantity of vapor produced in each effect with the help of vapor flow meters or condensate measurements.</li>
            <li>Calculate the mass of water evaporated by taking the difference between feed and concentrated liquid flow rates.</li>
            <li>Calculate the steam economy using the formula:<br />
                <em>Steam Economy = (Mass of water evaporated) / (Mass of steam supplied)</em>
            </li>
            <li>Determine the overall heat transfer coefficient (U) by using the formula:<br />
                <em>U = Q / (A × ΔT)</em>,<br />
                where Q is the heat supplied by steam, A is the heat transfer surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference between the steam and the boiling solution.</li>
            <li>Analyze the recorded data to evaluate the efficiency and performance of the multi-effect evaporator.</li>
            <li>After completion, close the steam valve, switch off the power supply, and allow the system to cool down before performing any maintenance.</li>
