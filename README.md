  <h2>About the Experiment</h2>
  <p>
    This experiment focuses on studying the performance of a Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE), a key unit operation in chemical and process industries. The MEE system is designed to efficiently utilize steam energy by using the vapor produced from one effect as the heating medium for the next. This reduces overall energy consumption significantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this experiment, the primary objectives are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To understand the working principle of a multi-effect evaporator.</li>
    <li>To experimentally determine the steam economy of the system.</li>
    <li>To evaluate the overall heat transfer coefficient for each effect.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By analyzing temperature, pressure, and flow measurements across multiple effects, students can better appreciate the advantages of multiple-effect evaporation over single-effect setups in terms of energy conservation and efficiency.
